  <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

  <section class="container">
    <h2>Distribution of highest and lowest incomes by race</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/distri_richest_race.png')}}" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p class="mt-3">Looking at the pie chart on the left, we see clearly two races that dominate the others
        when it comes to be the race with the highest houseold's median income in the state. Those communities are
        the asian and white communities. The conclusion we can drow for now, based on this data, is that white and asian
        houseolds are generally richer than the others. It is also clear that asian houseolds are a step above the white ones.
        Indeed, the chart shows that in 3 US states out of 4 it is the asian houseolds that have the highest median income.</p>

        <p>However this does not mean that they are always richer than other communities, huge differences can be hidden
        by this chart, and further analysis are needed to get a better insight of the economical situation of the communities
        in the US.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p class="mt-3">Looking at the pie chart on the right we can draw similar conclusions, as we did before.
        Three communities stand out, black, indian and other. Other is a bit problematic because we can not know for sure
        who it includes however based on what we know from the US population, it is highly possible that it consists of
        hispanic people.</p>
        <p>Again the chart shows one commnity with a higher frequence of representation. In this case it is the black community.
        We can see here that black houseolds have the lowest median income in 1 out of 2 states. So we may say they ususally have
        less ressources than other communities, as well as for indians and other communities.</p>
